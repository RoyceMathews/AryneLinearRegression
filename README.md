Goal:
  Generate the R^2 values of the aryne reaction experiement in 4 ways
    Training set
    Leave One Ligand Out
    Leave One (reaction) Out
    5 Fold 
  In each method linear regression coefficients are generated using a sub group of the complete data. These coefficients are then used to **predict**
  the gibbs free energy difference. The R^2 value is derived from the predicted and measured gibbs free energy difference

Instructions:
  Use 'regression using Gibbs.xlsx' to run main.py
